This repositoury contains the files for the simulations peformed with the dynamic-recursive, myopic version of OSeMOSYS-Greece, which is a linear programming optimization model representing the power sector of Greece with a technological detail from 2019 to 2070. The model computes the cost-optimal trajectory for the Greek (more details for the time-consistent version of the model can be found in Koutsandreas, D., Trachanas, G. P., Pappis, I., Nikas, A., Doukas, H., & Psarras, J. (2023). A multicriteria modeling approach for evaluating power generation scenarios under uncertainty: The case of green hydrogen in Greece. Energy Strategy Reviews, 50, 101233.). it introduces a consecutive decision-making process with a rolling one-year forward-looking window. At each step, the social planner assesses all future years from the perspective of being one year further into the future. Furthermore, the study employs two discount rate curves: one exponential and one logarithmic. Both curves reflect a declining interest in the future by decision-makers as time progresses, but the latter does so at a more rapid rate. This approach enables an examination of the impact of short-term preference and related time inconsistency on the power system formulation with a high level of temporal granularity. We further examine how our modelling of short-term preferencing interacts with different decarbonization mechanisms, including carbon prices and emission budgets.  
To perform the simulations, the added files must be extracted and named as ''data''.
